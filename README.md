## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned
- The body element can contain classes and id's just as any other element, but I never thought of every adding classes or id's to it, but it is very useful in times of adding background images when each page is different!
